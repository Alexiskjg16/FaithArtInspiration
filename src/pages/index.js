     <h1>Faith Art, An Artistic Act of Worship</h1>
     <p className={indexStyles.body}>Does it ever feel like you are trying to draw closer to God, but you just feel like he is not there? Or that everyone else has a 
         better relationship and knowledge of Jesus than you?  You begin to feel like you are alone in this walk.  You know that studying 
         the bible and praying are what you are suppose to do. Bible Journaling has been a great tool for me to dig deeper into the Word 
         and to draw closer to God.  I had no idea what journey God would take me on when I first started bible journaling 4 years ago. 
         God has revealed himself in a whole new way to me as I meet him on my bible pages with color and art. God has brought his Word
         and his stories to life and in turn to memory as I have read and then illustrated the verses in my bible.  I now remember 
         scriptures and story locations like never before only because I have engaged with God on another level.  Could it be that God 
         is waiting to meet you on the pages of your bible with color?  I know it can be intimidating because it is the Word of God 
         after all, but trust me when I say that when you open your heart and say yes to God he will take it from there.  Bible Journaling 
         is a fairly new art form that started around 2014 and it has taken off and moved hearts of women all across the globe. We are 
         all created in His image and he is the master artist and he has given us all a desire to create.  So I invite you to join me here
         every week as I share what I am doing in my bible journaling, learn how to use different mediums and how to achieve what God is 
         putting on your heart.</p>
